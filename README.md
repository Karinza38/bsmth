### Brian Smith (@bsmth) here ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Staff Technical Writer** on the MDN Web Docs team, building and
maintaining technical documentation.
[MDN Web Docs](https://github.com/mdn/content) is an open-source, collaborative
project that documents web platform technologies, including CSS, HTML,
JavaScript, and Web APIs. MDN serves 13,000 pages of documentation (and 43,000
pages of localized content) to approximately 15 million monthly visitors who
want to learn how the web works.

MDN's mission is to provide a blueprint for a better internet and empower a new
generation of developers and content creators to build it.

I wrote the docs at [QuestDB](https://github.com/questdb/questdb) - a blazing

I used to work at [EMnify](https://www.emnify.com/) where I built and maintained
