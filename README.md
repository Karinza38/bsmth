## My work

#### 🔬 QuestDB

I write docs at [QuestDB](https://github.com/questdb/questdb) - a blazing fast
open source time series database. QuestDB is a high-performance, open-source SQL
database for applications in financial services, IoT, machine learning, DevOps
and observability.

#### 📡 EMnify

I used to work at [EMnify](https://www.emnify.com/) where I built and maintained
the REST API documentation (OpenAPI). I also wrote a lot of cloud integration
guides guides and built example applications running on LTE devices that
interact with REST APIs.
