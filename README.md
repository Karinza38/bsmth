### 👋 Hi everyone, I'm bsmth 

I'm a __Technical Writer__ at QuestDB who loves open source software, IoT, and music technology.

- 📖 I've been building great developer docs in Berlin, Germany, since 2016. 
- 🧰 Tools and technologies I like to hack are 
  - __Swagger__ docs
  - __Python__ 
  - __Node.js__
  - __Ruby__
  - __Arduino & microcontrollers__
  - __All things IoT__

### 🔬 Projects

I write documentation at [QuestDB](https://github.com/questdb/questdb) - a blazing fast open source time series database.
The team behind QuestDB have built an incredibly efficient project from the ground up with a __lot__ or attention to performance details.

![QuestDB Demo](https://bsmthde-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/home/qdb-demo.png)

In order to build a super efficient system, some interesting optimizations are used:

* __ZeroGC__ - zero garbage collection 
* __SIMD__ instructions for high parallelization
* __Vectorized__ query execution
* __Zero Dependencies__ - the production artifact is about 3MB

There's a ton of reasons why you might want to use a time series database in your project if you're hacking on small IoT projects or building something larger that's data-intensive.
