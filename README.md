## My work

#### :fox_face: MDN @Mozilla

I'm a Staff Technical Writer at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org) where I
help document the web. If you would like to contribute to the MDN content, see
the [MDN Content repo](https://github.com/mdn/content) and don't forget to take
a look through the
[contribution guidelines](https://github.com/mdn/content#making-contributions).

#### ðŸ”¬ QuestDB

I wrote the docs at [QuestDB](https://github.com/questdb/questdb) - a blazing
fast open source time series database. QuestDB is a high-performance SQL
database for applications in financial services, IoT, machine learning, DevOps
and observability.

#### ðŸ“¡ EMnify

I used to work at [EMnify](https://www.emnify.com/) where I built and maintained
the REST API documentation (OpenAPI). I also wrote a lot of cloud integration
guides guides and built example applications running on LTE devices that
interact with REST APIs.
